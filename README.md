# Cursor Ruby on Rails Rules

A collection of opinionated rules and configurations for the [Cursor AI Code Editor](https://www.cursor.com) to speed up and enhance the development experience of Ruby on Rails developers. **The Cursor agent becomes your pair programming teammate and senior Rails expert.**

## Benefits

- Increased development speed
- Streamlined workflow for common Rails tasks
- Automated testing and use of RuboCop
- I18n support

## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't have an existing Rails project create one with `rails new your-rails-project --css tailwind`

To use these Cursor rules in your Ruby on Rails project:

### Option 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your Rails project directory
cd your-rails-project

# Clone the rules repository
git clone https://github.com/wintermeyer/cursor-rails-rules.git

# Copy the configuration files to your project
cp -r cursor-rails-rules/.cursor .

# Optional: Remove the cloned repository if you don't need it anymore
rm -rf cursor-rails-rules
```

### Option 2: Manual Download of the ZIP file

```bash
# Navigate to your Rails project directory
cd your-rails-project

# Download the ZIP file
curl -L https://github.com/wintermeyer/cursor-rails-rules/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o cursor-rails-rules.zip

# Extract the ZIP file
unzip cursor-rails-rules.zip

# Create the .cursor directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .cursor

# Copy the configuration files to your project
cp -r cursor-rails-rules/.cursor .

# Clean up downloaded files
rm cursor-rails-rules.zip
rm -rf cursor-rails-rules-main
```

### File Locations

The configuration files should be placed in the following locations within your Rails project:

```
your-rails-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .cursor/           # Cursor configuration directory
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/         # Custom rules directory
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... rest of your Rails project
```

Restart Cursor to be on the safe side.
